CS 515 Purdue University

High level of Linear Algebra including advanced topics:
such as Richardson, Steepest descent, Coordinate descent, Krylov subspace, Power method, rank-1 update, bipartie matrix, etc.


All the code is written using Julia language(version == 1.0.0).

.ipynb format is provided here.

There are several great IDEs for you to use when you write Julia code.
Atom, Jupyter notebook, and JuliaBox.
My personal preference would be JuliaBox, it is an online platform and we can easily access to it using our Google account.
